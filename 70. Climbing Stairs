You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=1)return 1; 
		int[] s=new int[n+1];
		s[1]=1;
		s[2]=2;
		for(int i=3;i<n+1;i++){
			s[i]=s[i-1]+s[i-2];
		}
		return s[n];
    }
}
